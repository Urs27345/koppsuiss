  "importedVeneer": "Imported veneer wood for kitchen, bathroom, and living room furniture. The highest quality veneer wood is used for all furniture and cabinetry. The wood is glued from at least 10 layers of thin wood panels and is therefore much more stable and water-resistant than the melamine wood commonly used in Bolivia, which is glued from wood chips. Our veneer is additionally protected with a wood-colored or white layer. All wood is processed into furniture by a Swiss carpenter to the highest standards here in Bolivia.",

Our outdoor units can operate several indoor units simultaneously. This means our air conditioners consume less electricity and, at the same time, the home looks more pleasant because fewer outdoor appliances are required. Furthermore, our indoor units are not bulky, clumsy objects that usually hang on the wall. Instead, the indoor units are discreetly hidden in the ceiling, allowing only small gaps to be seen.",
